For given number n - it is a prime number if it is divisable by any number apart form itself and 1. Example is 25. It is divisable by , 1,5, and 25. Similarly, 12 is divisable by 1,2,3,4,6 and 12. To check any number is prime or not, the better approach is not to check for all possible number (fron 1 to n), rather check for 1 to roo of (n). As after one point all the factors of the numbers are repeated. For an example : 12 - 1 X 12 , 12 X 1 , 3 X 4 , 4 X 3, 2 X 6 ,6 X2. It is better to check for 1 to roo of (12) which near around 3. In a nutshell, rather checking for i = 1 to i = n, we need to check from i = 1 to i \* i = n.
